 * agree to the last digit. A shadow lift worth two and a half stops in one and two in the other is
 * not a rounding difference; it is a preview that does not match the export, and the kind of
 * disagreement that survives for months because both halves look reasonable on their own.
 *
 * The shader interpolates these values into its source, so there is one place to change them and no
 * second copy to forget.
